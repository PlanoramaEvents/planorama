      <p>Welcome to Planorama, {{currentUser.published_name}}!</p>
      <p>
        You'll be using this site between now and the convention to view and manage your profile, interests and schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get started, click on <a href="/#/profile">Profile</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point there are 4 tabs in the profile. You will need to visit all of them.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>General Tab</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Update your name(s), pronouns, email address, bio, and social media as needed
            </li>
            <li>
              If you’re not going to be attending the convention in-person, please let us know the timezone that you will be in when you attend virtually.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Availability & Interests</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Fill in the maximum number of program items you would like to be on.
            </li>
            <li>
              Select blocks of time you will be available during the convention on the availability calendar.
            </li>
            <li>
              Select any of the specific cornerstone items you do not want to be scheduled against.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let us know any other scheduling constraints you have in the free text box.

        <li>
          <b>Session Selection</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use this tab to tell us what program items you are interested in.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can filter the options for one area, look through all options (over 600!) or search based on text in the title and description. (Note: You need to click the search button - hitting enter does not work.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Select sessions by using the slider to the right of the description. Your selections will save automatically.
            </li>
            <li>
              While some items are marked or otherwise described as Virtual, many we’re not sure if they will be taking place in-person or online, so everyone should feel free to sign up for items not marked either way.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Session Rankings</b>
          <p>
            The list of sessions you selected will display here. For each session:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Add a ranking 1-3. The ranking system is explained on the tab. You may leave panels unranked.
              </li>
              <li>
                Indicate moderation preference for the individual items.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use the text box to tell us why you are a good choice for this panel and what you would contribute.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Please follow the additional prompt, if present.
            <ul>
              <li>
                A sentence or two is often sufficient; essays are not required.
              </li>
              <li>
                We have about 1000 potential panelists and about two dozen staffers engaged in panelist assignments; this step helps us learn more about you in the context of a particular session.
